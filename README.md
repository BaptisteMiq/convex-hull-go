# 2D Convex Hull API in Go

Given a set of points in 2D space, this API will return a valid Convex Hull polygon using a Gift Wrapping algorithm written in Go.

## Definition

A Convex Hull is calculated from a set of points (with n >= 3) and defines the minimum convex polygon so that any point of the set is either inside or at the border of the polygon.

## Why

Convex Hull is often used in [video games](https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~haoz/pubs/liu_zhang_gi08.pdf), allowing to find simple collision polygon from complex shapes (see bellow sprite). This optimization allows to use [simpler and faster algorithms](https://www.toptal.com/game/video-game-physics-part-ii-collision-detection-for-solid-objects) without impacting user experience.

Furthermore, convex polygons are in some cases a good compromise between collision box simplicity and [collision mesh](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Collision_mesh) accuracy.

*Original sprite from [LuizMelo](https://luizmelo.itch.io/), The Convex Hull is drawn in red, it can be used as a collision polygon.*

Finding such polygon can be usefull in other fields like [shape analysis](https://brilliant.org/wiki/convex-hull/), [linear programming](https://cs.au.dk/~gerth/advising/thesis/bo-mortensen.pdf) and even in [cooking](http://veronising.blogspot.com/2008/04/cooking-for-nerds-ingredient-polyhedron.html).

## How

There are multiple algorithms to determine a convex hull, the one that I used in this program is the [Gift Wrapping algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_wrapping_algorithm), which as a time complexity of `O(mn)`. Other algorithms can be found on [this great pdf](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~misha/Spring16/06.pdf).

### Example

For this example, we suppose that points are not collinear. I'll not detail maths here, but you can find more details on the code itself, on the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull) and on this [video](https://youtu.be/YNyULRrydVI).

I made a tool to have a visual representation of the algorithm (you can find it inside the `/public` folder). Bellow screenshots have been taken from this tool.

Given this set of points:

![Step 0](https://i.imgur.com/A8VCrml.png)

The algorithm will first take the left-most point (point with minimum x value):

![Step 1](https://i.imgur.com/f0VCoH9.png)

Then rotate an imaginary line around it until it crosses another point:

![Step 2](https://i.imgur.com/lZOqdeV.png)

By repeating this process until we get back to the starting point, we get the Convex Hull:

## The API

The API is opened on port 8080 by default and has two routes:

```GET /``` : A static web page containing a tool to experiment with the API.

```POST /convex2d``` : The actual route that takes a list of points in the body (JSON format) and returns the list of points to construct the 2D Convex Hull (JSON format too).

Example of input:

```json
{ "points": [
    { "x": 239, "y": 308},
    { "x": 305, "y": 241},
    { "x": 377, "y": 321},
    { "x": 300, "y": 365},
    { "x": 302, "y": 301}
]}
```

The API returns:

```json
[
    { "x": 239, "y": 308 },
    { "x": 305, "y": 241 },
    { "x": 377, "y": 321 },
    { "x": 300, "y": 365 }
]
```

## How to start the application

If you want to test the API and the tool delivered with it, there are two built version that you can run: one Linux and one Windows version. You can run executables without any requirement, therefore you do **not** need Go to be installed.

The application will start the API on port 8080, and will close it when the application is terminated.

### Linux
```bash
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/BaptisteMiq/convex-hull-go.git
cd convex-hull-go

# Start with
./convex-hull
```

### Windows
```batch
git clone https://github.com/BaptisteMiq/convex-hull-go.git
cd convex-hull-go
start convex-hull.exe
```
or

Download ZIP and start `convex-hull.exe`.

## If you want to build from source...
*This program was written in Go 1.13.*

You will first need to clone the repository:

```bash
https://github.com/BaptisteMiq/convex-hull-go.git
cd convex-hull-go
```

Then install the required Go package (gin):
```bash
# You might need this library
sudo apt-get install libxi-dev

go get .
```

You can start the API with:
```bash
go run main.go
```

To build the app:
```bash
env GOOS=linux go build -trimpath   # Linux
env GOOS=windows go build -trimpath # Windows
```


## The tool

This tool can be accessed at http://localhost:8080 (when launched locally).

Click on the canvas to add a point at mouse position. The API will be called automatically and the Convex Hull will be drawn.
